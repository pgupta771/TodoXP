# *TodoXP*

## *Project Overview*
A full-stack *To-Do List* web application built using *Spring Boot, **Thymeleaf, and **MySQL.
Users can *add, toggle (mark as completed), and delete tasks, with all changes reflected in a **MySQL database. 
The app follows the **MVC architecture* with a *Controller layer* and *Repository layer* powered by *Spring Data JPA. 
The **frontend* is styled using *Bootstrap CSS* to ensure a clean and responsive design.
